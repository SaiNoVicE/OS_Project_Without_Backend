      <h3>Theory</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Any process must be loaded onto the main memory before it can be executed by the CPU. The operating system is
        responsible for allocation of all the necessary resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        In operating systems, memory management is the function responsible for allocating and managing a computer’s
        main memory. It keeps track of the status of each memory location, whether they are allocated or free, no
        illegal references are being made etc to ensure efficient use of main memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two techniques of memory management, contiguous and non-contiguous. We will be discussing the concepts
        of contiguous memory allocation in this section, while the algorithms used and non-contiguous memory allocation
        in further sections. They are as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Fixed partitioning (MFT): This is the oldest and simplest technique designed to load multiple processes into
          the main memory at once. The number of partitions in this technique is fixed, but the size of individual
          partitions may vary. Each process is loaded into one of the partitions.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Advantages:
              <ul>
                <li>Easy-to-implement: Since, the process just involves accommodating the processes into some partition,
                  there is little to no concern regarding internal or external fragmentation.</li>
                <li>Less-overhead: It is less computationally expensive and does not consume too much indirect
                  resources.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Disadvantages:
              <ul>
                <li>Internal-fragmentation: Internal fragmentation is generated as process size may be less than
                  partition size.</li>
                <li>Limit-on-process-size: Any process larger than the partition itself cannot be loaded onto the main
                  memory.</li>
                <li>Limit-on-number-of-processes: Maximum number of processes that can be loaded is limited by the
                  number of partitions that exist</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Variable partitioning (MVT): In contrast to fixed partitioning, it aims at a more dynamic approach. The
          partitions in the main memory are not made before loading the process but are created during run time. The
          partition created is equal to the process loaded, so internal fragmentation is avoided.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Advantages:
              <ul>
                <li>EInternal-fragmentation-eliminated: Since, the partition size is equal to the size of incoming
                  process size, no space is wasted within the partition.
                </li>
                <li>No-limit-on-size: As long as sufficient main memory is available, a process of any size can be
                  accommodated.
                </li>
                <li>No-limit-on-number: As long as sufficient main memory is available, any number of processes can be
                  accommodated.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Disadvantages:
              <ul>
                <li>Difficult-to-implement: It is more difficult to implement and has more overhead, as it is done
                  during run time.
                </li>
                <li>External-fragmentation: External fragmentation is still an issue as once a process is executed and
                  leaves the main memory, it leaves a hole behind. It might not be sufficient to load another process.
                  .</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
